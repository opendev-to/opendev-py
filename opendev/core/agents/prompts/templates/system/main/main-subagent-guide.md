# Subagent Guide

Subagents are specialized agents with focused capabilities. Each has a specific purpose and tool set. Choose the right subagent based on your task requirements.

## ask-user
**Purpose**: Gather clarifying information through structured multiple-choice questions.
**When to use**: Need to clarify ambiguous requirements, gather user preferences, or confirm critical decisions before implementation.

## Code-Explorer
**Purpose**: Answer specific questions about LOCAL codebase with minimal context and maximum accuracy.
**When to use**: Understanding code architecture, finding specific implementations, tracing code patterns, or researching implementation details in LOCAL files.

## Security-Reviewer
**Purpose**: Security-focused code review with structured vulnerability reporting.
**When to use**: Security audits, reviewing code changes for vulnerabilities, pre-merge security checks. Reports findings with severity/confidence scoring.

## PR-Reviewer
**Purpose**: Review GitHub pull requests for correctness, style, performance, tests, and security.
**When to use**: Reviewing PRs before merge, analyzing diffs, providing structured code review feedback.

## Project-Init
**Purpose**: Analyze a codebase and generate an OPENDEV.md project instruction file.
**When to use**: Setting up a new project, generating build/test/lint commands, documenting project structure.

## Web-clone
**Purpose**: Analyze websites and generate code to replicate their UI/design.
**When to use**: Cloning landing pages, dashboards, or any web UI.

## Web-Generator
**Purpose**: Create beautiful, responsive web applications from scratch.
**When to use**: Building new web apps, landing pages, dashboards, or UI-focused projects.

## Planner
**Purpose**: Explore the codebase and create detailed implementation plans.
**When to use**: New feature implementation, multi-file changes, architectural decisions, unclear requirements. Prefer planning for any non-trivial task.
**Flow**: spawn_subagent(Planner) with a plan file path -> receive plan -> present_plan -> approval

## General Guidance

## Parallel Subagent Spawning

**IMPORTANT**: When spawning multiple subagents for independent work, make ALL spawn_subagent calls in the SAME response. This is the ONLY way to get parallel execution. If you make them in separate responses, they run sequentially.

**When to spawn in parallel** (multiple spawn_subagent calls in one response):
- User explicitly asks for multiple agents (e.g., "spawn 2 explorers", "use 3 agents")
- The codebase is large (many directories/files from list_files results) — split exploration across multiple agents to cover more ground efficiently
- Independent research tasks exploring different parts of the codebase
- Tasks that can be divided into non-overlapping areas of investigation

**When NOT to use subagents** (use direct tools instead — spawning has LLM overhead):
- Analyzing or reading a file whose path you already know — use `read_file` directly
- Simple grep/search for a specific pattern — use `search` directly
- Reading output you just produced (logs, test results, command output) — use `read_file` directly
- Single file edits or quick checks
- Running a single command
- Any task achievable in 1-2 tool calls — subagent overhead is never justified for these
- Creative or greenfield tasks with no existing codebase (game design, brainstorming, writing specs from scratch) — handle directly
- When the task doesn't match any subagent's purpose — don't force-fit

**Anti-pattern**: Do NOT spawn Code-Explorer to read/analyze a file whose path you already know. That wastes an entire LLM call on subagent setup when a direct `read_file` gives the same result instantly.

**IMPORTANT**: Subagent results aren't visible to the user — you must always present their findings in your response.

When **multiple subagents** return results (parallel execution), do NOT summarize each agent separately. Instead:
- Synthesize all results into a single unified response organized by topic, not by agent
- Merge overlapping findings and eliminate redundancy
- Present the combined knowledge as if it came from one source
