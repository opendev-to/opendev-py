# Available Tools

Tool schemas are provided separately. Key categories:

**File**: read_file, write_file, edit_file
**Search**: list_files (glob patterns), search (regex with `type="text"` or AST with `type="ast"`)
**Symbols**: find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, rename_symbol, replace_symbol_body
**Commands**: run_command, list_processes, get_process_output, kill_process
**User Interaction**: ask_user (ask clarifying questions when implementing technical tasks with unclear requirements. Do NOT use for greetings, social messages, or simple conversations)
**Web**: fetch_url (use `deep_crawl=true` for crawling), capture_web_screenshot, capture_screenshot, analyze_image, open_browser
**MCP**: search_tools (keyword query) → discover MCP tools, then call them with data queries
**Todos**: write_todos, update_todo, complete_todo, list_todos, clear_todos
**Subagents**: spawn_subagent (for complex tasks, user questions, deep research, multi-file work)

**MCP Workflow**: `search_tools("github repository")` finds tools like `mcp__github__search_repositories`. Then call the discovered tool with your data query (e.g., `language:java stars:>=500`).

**Subagent Guidance**: Use `spawn_subagent` for tasks requiring fresh context: large features, deep research, multi-file refactoring, or asking user clarifying questions. Results aren't visible to user - summarize them. Don't spawn for single file edits or quick checks.
