    """Acquire an exclusive lock on a session file for safe concurrent writes.

    Uses fcntl.flock() which works across processes on macOS and Linux.
    The lock is automatically released when the context manager exits.

    Example:
        with exclusive_session_lock(session_file):
            # Safe to write to session file
            with open(session_file, 'w') as f:

    Args:
        session_file: Path to the session file to lock
        timeout: Maximum time in seconds to wait for lock acquisition (default: 10.0)

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If lock cannot be acquired within timeout period

    Note:
        On Windows, fcntl is not available. The lock becomes a no-op (silent fallback).
        For production Windows support, use msvcrt.locking() or filelock library.
