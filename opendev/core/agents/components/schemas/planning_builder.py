"""Planning tools set for subagent tool filtering.

PLANNING_TOOLS defines the set of read-only tools used by the Planner
sub-agent spec for codebase exploration.

# NOTE: PLANNING_TOOLS corresponds to ToolPolicy.resolve("minimal") + "spawn_subagent".
# The profile system in tool_policy.py provides a more flexible way to define
# tool access levels. This set is kept for backward compatibility.
