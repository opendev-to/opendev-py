# Tool Selection Guide

When choosing tools, prefer the more specific option:
- **Reading files**: read_file (NOT run_command with cat/head/tail)
- **Editing files**: edit_file (NOT run_command with sed/awk)
- **Creating files**: write_file (NOT run_command with echo/cat heredoc)
- **Searching code**: search (NOT run_command with grep/rg)
- **Listing files**: list_files (NOT run_command with find/ls)

## Tool vs Subagent Decision Guide

**Use direct tools when you have a known target** (specific file, function, pattern — typically 1-3 tool calls):
- "Read src/app.py" → `read_file` (known path, single file)
- "Show me the config file" → `read_file` + `list_files` (simple lookup)
- "Find function handleError" → `search` (specific code search)
- "List all Python files" → `list_files` (simple pattern match)
- "Find all API endpoints" → `search` with pattern (specific grep query)
- "What's in the database models?" → `read_file` on models.py (single file read)
- "Run the tests" → `run_command` (single command)

**Use subagents when exploration or specialization is needed** (5+ tool calls or multiple files):
- "How does authentication work?" → **Code-Explorer** (requires multi-file exploration)
- "What's the architecture of module X?" → **Code-Explorer** (needs comprehensive analysis)
- "Explain the error handling strategy" → **Code-Explorer** (multi-file trace)
- "Clone this website" → **Web-clone** (specialized task)
- "Should I use Redis or Memcached?" → **ask-user** (user preference needed)
- "Create a landing page for X" → **Web-Generator** (full web app creation)

**Use the Planner subagent for planning and design tasks**:
- "Design a caching layer" → **Planner** subagent (requires planning and design)
- "Implement user registration" → **Planner** subagent first for design, then implement (complex multi-step feature)

**Rule of thumb**:
- **Known target** (specific file, function, pattern) → **Direct tools** (1-3 tool calls)
- **Exploration needed** (understand how, find strategy, design approach) → **Subagent** (5+ tool calls or multiple files)
- **Single file** → **Direct** (never spawn a subagent for one file)
- **Multiple files or deep analysis** → **Subagent**
- **You already have the file path** → **Direct** (read it yourself, don't delegate)
- **Parallel subagents**: When the user requests multiple agents or the task has independent parts, make multiple spawn_subagent calls in a single response. They execute concurrently.
- **Parallel read-only tools**: When you need to read multiple files, search for multiple patterns, or fetch multiple URLs, make all the calls in a single response. Independent read-only tools (read_file, list_files, search, fetch_url, web_search) execute concurrently when batched together.
